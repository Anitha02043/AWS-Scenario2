# AWS Scenario 2 â€“ Secure File Storage and Backup using AWS S3 and IAM

## Aim
To implement secure file storage, backup, and access management using Amazon S3 and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

## Objective
The objective of this scenario is to create a centralized and secure storage system for files and data backups. It ensures data integrity, restricted access, and high durability using AWS cloud infrastructure.

## Procedure
1. Create an S3 bucket for storing data and files.
2. Configure bucket permissions and access control lists (ACLs).
3. Set up IAM users and groups with defined policies.
4. Apply versioning and lifecycle rules for automatic backup and archiving.
5. Enable server-side encryption for data security.
6. Upload test files to validate access restrictions.
7. Use AWS CLI or Console to test upload and retrieval operations.
8. Configure CloudWatch for monitoring storage usage.
9. Test restricted access by simulating unauthorized access attempts.
10. Review logs and confirm that data is secured and backed up properly.

## Services Used
- Amazon S3
- AWS IAM
- CloudWatch
- AWS CLI

## Outcome
A reliable and secure file storage and backup system implemented using AWS S3, with proper access control and data encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
